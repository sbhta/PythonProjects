## Introduction:
I have been learning python for the past 3 years, I think I know 
the language pretty well. here you can find all of my projects that im 
proud of.

## Skills:
- As said above I have been learning python for about 3 years at this point.
- I have got minor experience in the database SQLite, and can create a simple Login system using the library.
- I would consider my self pretty experienced in creating GUIs in the different modules such as: 
  pygame, tkinter, turtle and DearPyGui. The GUI complexity can vary: be it a simple one for a card game,
  or a complex one for software that can run in the background.
  
## what will you find on this git
- here as you can see you can find all the major projects that were made. for 
  example: a sudoku solver, a simple login system, a file sorter, morse code creator!
